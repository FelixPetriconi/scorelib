Scorelib is a C++ library which parses data files generated by the SCORE notation editor.

<h1> Example SCORE data </h1>

Each musical item is represented by a list of numeric parameters
in the SCORE editor.  These value are typically stored in a <a
href=../formats/binary>binary file format</a>, but can be saved as
lines of numbers in ASCII text with the PMX command.  Lines in the
PMX data can occur in any order (except for certain items type like
text objects which consist of two adjacent lines).  The PMX data
for the following musical example is given underneath it, with the
data lines sorted temporally with the <a
href=../program/scorecat>scorecat</a> program.
