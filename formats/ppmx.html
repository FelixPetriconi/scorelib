PPMX stands for "Paged Parameter MatriX". PPMX data is a generalization
of PMX files that allows multiple pages of data to be stored in a
single file.  This allows an entire movement, single-movement work,
multi-movement work, or collection of works to be stored in a single
file. PPMX is not a native format of the SCORE editor, but is
designed to be compatible for reading into SCORE with the <b>RE</b>
or <b>RE*</b> commands. PPMX data will be read into the SCORE editor
as a macro, causing SCORE to write the individual pages into separate
binary page files, using filenames given in the PPMX data.

The PPMX format is designed to be compatible with the SCORE editor.  If PPMX data 
loaded into the SCORE editor with the RE command, then the above PPMX template
will create three files "page1.mus", "page2.mus", and "page3.mus" in the 
<a href=/formats/binary>binary SCORE format</a>.

<p> <b>RS</b> <b>SA</b> and <b>SM</b> are case insensitive, but
should be given in upper case to increase visibility.  These are
technically macro commands in the SCORE editor (meaning "reset",
"save to filename", and "save to same filename").  But for PPMX
data, these are considered file boundary markers, and no other SCORE
macro commands are allowed in PPMX data, or they will be ignored.

<p> Each page's PMX data in a PPMX file must start with <b>RS</b> on a line 
by itself, and starting at the beginning of the line.  This is followed by 
"<b>SA <i>filename</i></b>", where <i>filename</i> is the name of the file
that the PMX data would be stored into when loading into the SCORE editor. 
Preferably this filename does not include a file extension.  The end of a
page should be marked with <b>SM</b> starting on a line by itself, and
there should be no PMX content between any <b>SM</b> ending one page, and <b>RS</b>
starting a new page.
